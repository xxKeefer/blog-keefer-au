            <p>
              I love tech. They say any sufficiently advanced tech is like magic
              to the uninitiated, and who doesn&apos;t want to be a Wizard? I
              love to use React and Typescript to turn problems into magic on
              the internet. Outside of tech, I have been married to my
              highschool sweetheart for {yearsSince('09-11-2013')} years and
              have two wonderful daughters. I love to cook as a bit of a zen
              activity to avoid burnout, my pickled onions are to die for.
              What&apos;s left of my free time get spent telling stories with
              friends through role playing games. Currently I enjoy helping one
              of my best friends to develop a rules system for telling stories
              called Omen.

                After a year of bustin&apos; hump, working part time, studying
                part time and juggling friends and family. I had finished my
                boot camp at Coder Academy and I was ready to take my new skills
                and kill it in Tech.

                I finally arrived in the Tech world! I got my first real

                people and amazing ideas about how work culture should be. I
                can&apos;t thank the friends I made there during my time at

                I made the decision to take on bigger challenges at VaxApp. It
                was a tough decision at the time but it has paid off. I loved
                the feeling of doing something important by streamlining
                vaccination processes during the height of the pandemic. I get
                to help a lot of people with my dev skills whilst learning a lot
                in a fast paced start up.

                My wife broke her leg! And we have stairs in our house. She and
                my daughters had to move into the in laws home while I took care
                of the pets at home. It was five long months of missing my
                family and I am very grateful to my in laws for looking after
                them during that time.

                I left Vitavo{' '}
                <span className="italic">(formerly known as VaxApp)</span> to
                move into doing some enterprise software with a company called
                Transmax. It&apos;s the biggest engineering team I have ever
                worked with and I have learned a lot already about enterprise
                software, working across teams and more robust architectures.
                I&apos;m having a blast participating in communities of practice
                and making motorways that much smarter.

                I am really enjoying my time at Transmax. I&apos;m getting to
                solve some worthwhile problems, champion best practices, and
                mentor the juniors on my team. I find myself getting a deeper
                understand of frontend fundamentals and at the same time
                learning about other spheres from my colleagues. Things like
                backend, AIT and DevOps to name a few fields.
