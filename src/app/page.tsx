            I love tech. They say any sufficiently advanced tech is like magic
            to the uninitiated, and who doesn&apos;t want to be a Wizard? I love
            to use React and Typescript to turn problems into magic on the
            internet. Outside of tech, I have been married to my highschool
            sweetheart for {yearsSince('09-11-2013')} years and have two
            wonderful daughters. I love to cook as a bit of a zen activity to
            avoid burnout, my pickled onions are to die for. What&apos;s left of
            my free time get spent telling stories with friends through role
            playing games. Currently I enjoy helping one of my best friends to
            develop a rules system for telling stories called Omen.

              part time and juggling friends and family. I had finished my boot

              kill it in Tech.

              amazing ideas about how work culture should be. I can&apos;t thank

              I made the decision to take on bigger challenges at VaxApp. It was
              a tough decision at the time but it has paid off. I loved the
              feeling of doing something important by streamlining vaccination
              processes during the height of the pandemic. I get to help a lot
              of people with my dev skills whilst learning a lot in a fast paced
              start up.

              My wife broke her leg! And we have stairs in our house. She and my
              daughters had to move into the in laws home while I took care of
              the pets at home. It was five long months of missing my family and
              I am very grateful to my in laws for looking after them during
              that time.

              I left Vitavo{' '}
              <span className="italic">(formerly known as VaxApp)</span> to move
              into doing some enterprise software with a company called
              Transmax. It&apos;s the biggest engineering team I have ever
              worked with and I have learned a lot already about enterprise
              software, working across teams and more robust architectures.
              I&apos;m having a blast participating in communities of practice
              and making motorways that much smarter.

              I am really enjoying my time at Transmax. I&apos;m getting to
              solve some worthwhile problems, champion best practices, and
              mentor the juniors on my team. I find myself getting a deeper
              understand of frontend fundamentals and at the same time learning
              about other spheres from my colleagues. Things like backend, AIT
              and DevOps to name a few fields.
